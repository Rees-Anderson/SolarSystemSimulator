This link will take you to the hosted page for the WebGL build of the game - it will run in your browser without a download!
WebGL is a browser based graphics API, and it is supported natively by common browsers like Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

Note: The application is designed to be viewed on a 1920x1080 monitor, there may be UI scaling issues on larger or smaller screens.
      For the best experience use a 1920x1080 monitor and enter fullscreen (lower right corner after clicking the link).
